# TaxiOKA - Medical Taxi Dispatch System

## Overview
TaxiOKA is a dispatch system designed specifically for a small medical taxi company based in Marseille, France. Unlike traditional taxi applications, TaxiOKA focuses on handling scheduled patient transport to and from hospitals, with minimal unscheduled calls during the day.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this codebase is to facilitate the management and dispatch of medical taxi rides. Patients typically order rides to travel from their homes to hospitals for medical exams and return trips after their appointments.

## Key Features and Considerations
- Scheduling primarily revolves around pre-booked rides for patients.
- The main variability in dispatching arises from the unpredictable duration of patients' hospital stays.
- The system aims to optimize taxi availability and routing based on patient schedules and hospital timings.
- Designed to support a small-scale operation with a focus on reliability and ease of use.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance code quality and modularity.
- Implement comprehensive automated tests.
- Improve user interface and experience.
- Optimize dispatch algorithms for better efficiency.

## Testing
Plans include adding unit and integration tests to ensure system reliability and facilitate future development.
