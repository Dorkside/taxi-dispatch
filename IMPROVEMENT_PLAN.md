# Improvement Plan for TaxiOKA Codebase

## 1. Code Quality and Organization
- Refactor Vue components for better modularity and reusability.
- Review and improve data models for clarity and maintainability.
- Organize store modules to separate concerns and improve state management.
- Ensure consistent coding style and linting rules across the project.

## 2. Testing Strategy
- Introduce unit tests for Vue components using a testing framework like Jest or Vue Test Utils.
- Add unit tests for data models and utility functions.
- Implement integration tests for store and database interactions.
- Plan for end-to-end (E2E) tests to cover critical user flows using tools like Cypress or Playwright.
- Set up continuous integration (CI) to run tests automatically on commits.

## 3. Database and Backend
- Review and improve database access layer for error handling and performance.
- Add validation and sanitization for data inputs.
- Ensure secure handling of sensitive data and environment variables.

## 4. User Interface and Experience
- Review UI components for accessibility and responsiveness.
- Improve user feedback and error messages.
- Optimize performance for faster load and interaction times.

## 5. Build and Deployment
- Update dependencies to latest stable versions.
- Review build configuration for optimization.
- Automate deployment process if not already done.

## 6. Documentation
- Expand README with setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- Document codebase architecture and key modules.
- Provide examples and tutorials for common tasks.

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Explore advanced dispatch algorithms to optimize taxi routing.
- Add support for real-time updates and notifications.
- Integrate with external systems like hospital scheduling APIs if applicable.
