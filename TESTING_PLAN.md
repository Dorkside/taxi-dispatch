# Testing Plan for TaxiOKA Codebase

## 1. Testing Framework Setup
- Add Jest and Vue Test Utils to the project as dev dependencies.
- Configure Jest to work with Vue single-file components (.vue).
- Add scripts to package.json for running tests and watching changes.

## 2. Unit Testing
- Write unit tests for Vue components using Vue Test Utils.
- Test component rendering, props, events, and methods.
- Write unit tests for data models and utility functions.

## 3. Integration Testing
- Test Vuex store modules and their interactions.
- Test database access and API interaction layers.

## 4. End-to-End Testing (Future)
- Consider adding Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.
- Cover critical user flows like booking a ride, dispatching, and administration.

## 5. Continuous Integration
- Integrate tests into CI pipeline to run on every commit.
- Ensure code coverage reports and test result notifications.

## Example: Installing Testing Dependencies

```bash
yarn add --dev jest @vue/test-utils vue-jest babel-jest
```

## Example: package.json scripts addition

```json
"scripts": {
  "test:unit": "jest --config jest.config.js",
  "test:unit:watch": "jest --watch"
}
```

## Example: Basic Unit Test for Calendar.vue

Create a test file `tests/unit/Calendar.spec.js`:

```javascript
import { shallowMount } from '@vue/test-utils';
import Calendar from '@/components/Calendar.vue';

describe('Calendar.vue', () => {
  it('renders calendar component', () => {
    const wrapper = shallowMount(Calendar);
    expect(wrapper.exists()).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

This plan will help introduce a robust testing culture to the TaxiOKA project, improving code quality and reliability.
